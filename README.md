# Face Mask Detection Application 🦺😷

This repository contains a face mask detection application built with **PyQt5** and **OpenCV**. The application captures live video from a webcam, detects faces, and indicates whether each person is wearing a mask.

## Features 🌟

- **Real-time Video Feed**: Displays live video from the webcam. 🎥
- **Face Detection**: Uses Haar cascades to detect faces in the video feed. 👤
- **Mask Classification**: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to classify faces as "Mask" or "No Mask." ✅❌
- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with PyQt5, providing start and stop buttons for webcam control. 🖱️
- **Multi-threading**: Ensures smooth video capture and GUI responsiveness. ⚡

## Requirements 📋

Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x 🐍
- OpenCV 📸
- TensorFlow (for the mask detection model) 🔍
- PyQt5 🖥️
- NumPy ➕


2. Click the "Start" button to begin the webcam feed. The application will process each frame and display the mask status for detected faces. 🏃‍♂️
3. Click the "Stop" button to end the webcam feed. 🛑

## Logic Behind the Application 🧠

This code implements a face mask detection system that can be applied to images or video frames. It detects faces using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier and predicts whether each detected face is wearing a mask using a pre-trained deep learning model. The results are visually indicated by text labels and colored rectangles around the faces in the output frame. 🎨
